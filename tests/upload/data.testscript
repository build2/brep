# Pre-created upload data directory that will be copied by subsequent tests
# and scope setup commands. The common approach will be that group scopes copy
# and modify the parent scope upload data directory as required by the nested
# tests and scopes. Tests will also clone the parent scope upload data
# directory to optionally modify it, use and cleanup at the end. Note that
# upload data directory can not be shared between multiple upload handler
# processes. Also we need to make sure that upload data directories are not
# cloned while being used by upload handler scripts.
