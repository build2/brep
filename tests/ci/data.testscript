# Pre-created CI request data directory that will be copied by subsequent
# tests and scope setup commands. The common approach will be that group
# scopes copy and modify the parent scope submission directory as required
# by the nested tests and scopes. Tests will also clone the parent scope
# submission data directory to optionally modify it, use and cleanup at the
# end. Note that configuration can not be shared between multiple submission
# handler processes. Also we need to make sure that submission data
# directories are not cloned while being used by submission handler scripts.
