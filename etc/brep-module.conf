# connect to the local instance of PostgreSQL with the operating system-
# default mechanism (Unix-domain socket, etc) and use operating system
# (login) user name and the database called 'brep_package'. If the role name
# is not empty then the login user will be switched (with SET ROLE) to this
# user prior to executing any statements. If not specified, then 'brep' is

# Directory containing build bot agent public keys. If specified, then brep

# Regular expressions in the /<regex>/<replacement>/ form for transforming the

# Time to wait before considering a package for a forced rebuild. Must be

# build-forced-rebuild-timeout 600


# Time to wait before considering a package for a soft rebuild (only to be
# performed if the build environment or any of the package dependencies have
# changed). Must be specified in seconds. The special zero value disables soft
# rebuilds. Default is 24 hours.
#
# build-soft-rebuild-timeout 86400


# Alternative package soft rebuild timeout to use instead of the soft rebuild
# timeout (see the build-soft-rebuild-timeout option for details) during the
# specified time interval. Must be specified in seconds. Default is the time
# interval length plus (build-soft-rebuild-timeout - 24h) if soft rebuild
# timeout is greater than 24 hours (thus the rebuild is only triggered within
# the last 24 hours of the build-soft-rebuild-timeout expiration).
#
# The alternative rebuild timeout can be used to "pull" the rebuild window to
# the specified time of day, for example, to optimize load and/or power
# consumption of the build infrastructure (off-work hours, solar, off-peak
# electricity tariffs, etc). A shorter than the time interval rebuild timeout
# can also be used to force continuous rebuilds, for example, to shake out
# flaky tests. Note also that if the alternative rebuild timeout is greater
# than the normal rebuild timeout, then this will result in slower rebuilds
# during the alternative time interval. In this case, if the build
# infrastructure is monitored for delayed package builds, then the alternative
# rebuild timeout should only be made slightly greater than the normal timeout
# (see brep-monitor(1) for details).
#
# The time interval boundaries must be specified as times of day (in the local
# timezone) in the <hours>:<minutes> form. If the stop time is less than the
# start time then the interval extends through midnight. The start and stop
# times must both be either specified or absent. If unspecified, then no
# alternative rebuild timeout will be used.

# Enable or disable package build notification emails in the <name>=<mode>

# built with this toolchain. If 'latest' is specified, then for this toolchain
# name the emails are only sent for the latest version of a package. If 'none'
